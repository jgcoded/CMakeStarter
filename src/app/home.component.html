<h1>Welcome</h1>

This website is a simple tool to help C++ developers quickly start new CMake-based projects. 

The tool generates an entire C++ project with boiler-plate CMake files and source code, and the
generated project can be downloaded as a zip file.

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Generated CMake code is documented</li>
  <li>Add custom projects and specify the dependencies amongst one another</li>
  <li>Support for third party dependencies that are available to download via Git or a compressed archive</li>
  <li>Support for Make-based or CMake-based third party dependencies</li>
  <li>Third party dependencies are managed by CMake ExternalProject targets</li>
  <li>The dependency graph of the projects are topologically sorted during CMake file generation</li>
  <li>Live preview of folder structure and generated files</li>
  <li>Download cross-platform, build-ready zip file of the project</li>
</ul>

The tool takes an opinionated approach to the generated folder structure, and it is not a one-size fits all solution,
especially since C++ code bases can vary wildly from project to project. This tool provides the minimum necessary to allow
developers to create a cross-platform build with third-party dependencies included.

As such, the generated project files will most likely have to be modified in some way - and that's ok. As long as this
tool can save a developer a few minutes of writing boiler-plate CMake code then this tool has succeeded.

<h2>Shortcomings</h2>

Because of all the possible variety of project structures within third party dependencies, this tool has some shortcomings that may cause
developers to manually modify the generated files. In any case, the developer will know that there's a problem with third party dependencies
because the linker tool will let them know that there's a missing library. To fix this issue, simple edit the 3rdParty.cmake file
in the cmake folder. These are the assumptions made by the tool:

<ul>
  <li>
    <h4>Every third party dependency only outputs one library</h4>

    For example, the mongoc library has option to include a dependent project, bson, in its build. Because of this assumption, however,
    the tool will only create a CMake target for mongoc and not bson.
  </li>

  <li>
    <h4>The library name for the third party dependency is something like lib<i>depdency_name</i>.lib</h4>

    For example, a library named foo outputs a library called libfoo.lib. The generated CMake will find this library and include it in the lib.
    Another porject named bar outputs a library called libbar-1.0.lib. The generated CMake will not find this library because of the extra version
    information appended to the name.
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Every dependency is cross-platform</h4>

    If a dependency is not cross-platform, then the developer must edit the CMake file so that a project is not included on the unsupported
    platform.
  </li>
</ul>
